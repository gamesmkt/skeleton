# A Boilerplate repo for contributions

**Note:** Replace ```:service_namespace``` ```:service_name``` ```:package_name``` .

This is where your description should go. Add a little code example so build can understand real quick how the package can be used. Try and limit it to a paragraph or two.

## Changelog
